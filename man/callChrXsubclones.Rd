}
\arguments{
\item{tumourname}{The sample name used for Battenberg (i.e. the tumour BAM file name without the .bam extension)}

\item{X_gamma}{The PCF gamma value for segmentation of 1000G SNP LogR values (Default 1000)}

\item{X_kmin}{The min number of SNPs to support a segment in PCF of LogR values (Default 100)}

\item{genomebuild}{The genome build used in running Battenberg (hg19 or hg38)}

\item{AR}{Should the segment carrying the androgen receptor (AR) locus to be visually distinguished in average plot? (Default TRUE)}

\item{prior_breakpoints_file}{A two column text file with prior genome-wide breakpoints, possibly from structural variants. This file must contain two columns with headers "chr" and "pos" representing chromosome and position.}

\description{
Function to call ChrX copy number based on LogR (suitable for male samples). Copy number
cannot be called for the non-PAR region of ChrX due to the hemizygosity of all 1000G SNPs.
This function enables calling subclonal copy number for the non-PAR region by segmenting LogR.
A number of correction steps are undertaken to account for the noisy nature of LogR. This function
requires the following libraries: copynumber, data.table and ggplot2. It reads in three files generated
by previous steps of Battenberg, namely samplename_mutantLogR_gcCorrected.tab, samplename_purity_ploidy.txt
and samplename_copynumber_extended.txt.
This function will also update the Battenberg genome-wide profile plots (average.png and subclones.png) to include the chrX profile by also
reading in the samplename.BAFsegmented.txt and samplename_rho_psi.txt files
